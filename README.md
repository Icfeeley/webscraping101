All code examples have been written and tested in python 2.7 on a Linux, the libraries should all work with python 3 and on mac, and windows, but the code may not work as written on your system.

If you have pip installed you can install all of the libraries used in the examples all at once (after cloning the repo on your system) by typing,
	pip install -r requirements.txt
at the commandline.
